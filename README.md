# aws-lex-grist-mental-health
An AWS Lex implementation of the GRiST mental health risk assessment system that allows users to self-assess their mental-health to determine whether they are at risk. If users are at risk we provide links to support services (e.g. PAPYRUS HOPELineUK) for immediate access. A futher aim is to help filter the increasing demand on mental-health services and prioritise high-risk patients.

[GRiST](https://www.egrist.org/ "GRiST Website") uses a computational model of psychological processes to represent structured clinical judgements of multidisciplinary mental-health practitioners. GRiST models clinicians' expertise and how they perceive and assess mental health risk with the aim to assist with the early detection of mental-health risks. 

GRiST is being used by various NHS secondary Mental Health Trusts, charities, IAPT services. Recently, a version tailored to the needs of paramedics, A&E and other front line agencies was introduced to enable non-experts, such as 111 paramedics, to assess the initial risk of mental health patients in the same way that clinicians do. This allows high-risk patients to be directed to the right place for detailed monitoring.
